# Lab 4: Seven-segment display decoder



### Learning objectives

The purpose of this laboratory exercise is to design a 7-segment display decoder and to become familiar with the VHDL structural description that allows you to build a larger system from simpler or predesigned components.




## Preparation tasks (done before the lab at home)

The Nexys A7 board provides two four-digit common anode seven-segment LED displays (configured to behave like a single eight-digit display). See schematic or reference manual of the Nexys A7 board and find out the connection of 7-segment displays, ie to which FPGA pins are connected and how.
